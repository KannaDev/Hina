Are you planning on fixing bugs, making suggestions or adding new features?

If so, make sure you do them in the following format:

To make a suggestion, go to [Issues](https://github.com/KannaDev/Hina/issues). And make an issue titled "Suggestion: (suggestion)", then fill out a description of the suggestion, and make sure to search to make sure it has not been suggested by any other user.

If you would like to make a contribution, create a fork, make the needed changes and then make a PR to the [main branch](https://github.com/KannaDev/Hina/tree/main).
Before your changes are added. They will be tested to ensure nothing breaks.
